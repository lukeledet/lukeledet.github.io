# Rowing Goals

This repo is an experiment in testing different LLMs and tools for creating a basic web application to track rowing goals. There will be different branches for different tools, LLMs, prompting approaches and tech stacks.

To start a new experiment, create a new branch off of the `clean` branch with this format: tool-model[-approach] where approach is optional. The `clean` branch has an empty README so it doesn't confuse the model.
